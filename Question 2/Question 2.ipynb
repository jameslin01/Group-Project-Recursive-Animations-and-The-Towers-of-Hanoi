    "\n",
    "The function below generates data for a tree which is stored as two lists of branches. The first list, trunks represents the trunks of every new generated tree and the second list takes only the end branches. Since every branch in the recursive tree is either an end branch or the trunk of another tree then those two lists suffice.Each value in the trunks list is given by [[[x0,y0],[x1,y1]],d] where (x0,y0) are the start points of the trunk, (x1,y1) are the end points of the branch and d is the thickness of the trunk. This allows us to build a tree with more structure. \n",
